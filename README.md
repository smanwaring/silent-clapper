## Welcome the world of Silent Salutations!

A fun little "silent-clapper" I built during a 24 hour hackathon -- and have since souped-up. Silent Salutations uses sockets to connect people who are watching your presentation remotely and allows them to participate in a visual-applaud (and more...depending on the icons available to them). 


## Prerequisites

postgres - make sure you have it running!
make a database locally called silentSalutations

## Get Started

Short and sweet:

```
npm install
npm start

```
Launch the app in your browser.
